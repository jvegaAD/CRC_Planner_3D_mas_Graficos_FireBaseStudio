# **App Name**: Ganttastic

## Core Features:

- Interactive Gantt Chart: Displays a Gantt chart where each cell represents the status of a task on a given day.
- Status Indication: Users can click each cell in the Gantt chart to toggle through statuses (e.g., 'Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Blocked', 'Completed') represented by different colors. Status is stored locally only.
- SharePoint Integration Helper: Analyzes and updates the code so that it will integrate with a SharePoint instance.
- Task Definitions: Users can define tasks in the project (e.g., Foundations, Concrete, Masonry, Insulation, Installations).
- Day Definitions: Users can define the days tracked in the project (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, etc.).
- Dynamic Chart Generation: Dynamically generates the Gantt chart based on the defined tasks and days.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft sky blue (#87CEEB) to create a calm and organized feeling.
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF) that is close to white.
- Accent color: Light aquamarine (#7FFFD4), providing gentle contrast and signalling the interactive nature of the grid.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for headlines or body text.
- Simple icons for task status.
- Clean, table-based layout for the Gantt chart. Use shadow effects on cells to give the grid some visual depth.
- Subtle transitions when changing the status of a cell.
